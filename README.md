# battleship
A Java implementation of the classic battleship game. The user plays against a simple AI using a graphical user interface. The five best plays (the least shots needed to destroy the AI's fleet) are saved in the high score list.

I created this as a course project after my first programming courses in 2010. The game interface and source code are in Finnish.

**Compile:**
javac Laivanupotus.java

**Run:**
java Laivanupotus
